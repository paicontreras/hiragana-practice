##About the Project

When you learn Japanese, you need to memorize two complete syllabaries of 46 symbols each one: hiragana and katakana. In this project, you will master the hiragana characters through translating Japanese sentences from hiragana to latin alphabet (and vice versa). Getting your own statistic of the symbols you've learned well and the ones you need to keep practicing. In other words: you will learn hiragana like a sensei, for free. 

This project was made as part of Learn IT, Girl program. My amazing mentor is Anahita Davoudi.
